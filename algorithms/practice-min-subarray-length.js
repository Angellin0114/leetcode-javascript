/*
Write a function called minSubLength which accepts two parameters, an array of positive integers and a positive integer. This function should return the minimal length of a continuous subarray - the sum of elements inside this subarray has to be greater than or equal to the positive interger parameter. If subarray not found, then return 0;

Ex:
  minSubLength([9,8,1,4,9,5,1,2],11) //2
*/
const minSubLength = (arr, size) => { }
