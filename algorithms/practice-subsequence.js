/*
A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of characters without distrubing the relative position of the remaining characters.

Write a function that checks if one string is a subsequence of the other string.

EX:
  isSubsequence("hello", "hello Dear"); true
  isSubsequence("book", "brooklyn"); true
  isSubsequence("abc", "bac"); false
